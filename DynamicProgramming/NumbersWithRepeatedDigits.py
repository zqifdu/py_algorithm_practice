Let cnt_non_dup be the count of the non-duplicate numbers smaller than N.
Then the answer is N - cnt_non_dup.

For all k-digit numbers, we know the count of non-duplicate numbers are
9 * A(9, k - 1), where A is the permutation.

So for N, let's assume it is k digit, we can easily compute count of
non-duplicate numbers for (1,2,3,4,k-1) digit. Then we need to compute the
non-duplicate numbers in the range [10^(k - 1), N]

We first compute N to a list of integers. Take 25654 as an example.

We first look for numbers like 1xxxx, the result is A(9, 4)

Next, look for numbers like 2(0-4)xxx, the result is 5 * A(8, 3), but 2 is used,
so we only have 4 * A(8, 3)

Next, look for numbers like 25(0-5)xx, the result is 6 * A(7, 2), but 2 and 5
are used, so we only have 4 * A(7, 2)

Next, look for numbers like 256(0-4)x, the result is 5 * A(6, 1), but 2 is used,
so we only have 4 * A(6, 1)

Therefore, assume we have x at i-th digit, then the numbers smaller than N by change
the (i + 1) to the last digits are A(9 - i, k - i - 1) times the number of number
not used in the range of [0, x).

Need to be careful about the first digit, it cannot be 0.
